<html><body><p>US Economics  | North America GDP Forecast Change: More Than A Mark-to-Market </p><p>Fresh data point to  more strength in the industrial sector than we had anticipated. We are making a sizable upward revision to GDP this year (+0.9pp to 1.3% 4Q/4Q) with the largest contribution coming from S&L investment. PCE, jobs, and inflation are tracking in line with our expectation. </p><p>We have maintained our out-of-consensus call for a  soft landing  since early </p><p>last year. The data have continued to move in our direction, our view  has </p><p>only strengthened, and a soft landing has  become consensus. Incoming data </p><p>now point to a more comfortable soft landing than we had anticipated, led </p><p>by public investment in infrastructure and nonresidential structures </p><p>investment. </p><p>First quarter real GDP grew at an annualized pace of 2.0% and we are </p><p>currently tracking 2Q real GDP at 1.8%. The first half of 2023 is on track for </p><p>1.9% growth on average vs. 0.5% previously forecasted in our mid-year </p><p>outlook.  We have raised our forecast for real GDP by 0.9pp to 1.3% 4Q/4Q in </p><p>2023 and by 0.1pp to 1.4% in 2024. </p><p>Key  contributors to our GDP forecast upgrade (in other words, where </p><p>we've been wrong): </p><p>Non-residential structures investment  is the largest contributor to our </p><p>GDP upgrade this year adding an additional 0.3pp to growth, reflecting a </p><p>strong manufacturing cycle that we expect  to continue through the year. </p><p>Nominal manufacturing construction in the tech space coupled with </p><p>moderating costs has built up tremendous momentum. We have raised our </p><p>forecast for non-resi structures investment by 9.7pp to 12.9% 4Q/4Q in 2023 </p><p>and by 4.8pp to 1.9% in 2024. </p><p>State & local (S&L) investment  is stronger than expected from increased </p><p>public investment in infrastructure. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs </p><p>Act , which was signed into law in November 2021 and provided roughly </p><p>$1.2tn of federal funding,  is  driving a boom in large-scale infrastructure. We </p><p>have raised our forecast for S&L investment by 2.0pp to 4.0% 4Q/4Q in </p><p>2023 and by 0.4pp to 1.4% in 2024. </p><p>What we are getting right (importantly, the long-held soft landing view): </p><p>The consumption story remains intact.   A rising savings rate is shrinking the </p><p>spending pie, resulting is continued softness in goods  and steady </p><p>deceleration in services spending.  Motor vehicles remains a source of </p><p>volatility due to ongoing supply shortages and pent-up demand. We have </p><p>made a marginal +0.2pp adjustment to real PCE growth to 1.5% 4Q/4Q this </p><p>year, and -0.1pp to 0.9% in 2024. </p><p> Idea </p><p> Institutional Investor Global Fixed Income Poll is now open.

We continue to see core PCE </p><p>inflation at 3.4% 4Q/4Q this year and 2.2% in 2024. Incoming data has </p><p>confirmed our expectation that core goods prices turn once again </p><p>deflationary and core services experience further deceleration. </p><p>Job growth is slowing.  Our deep dive into the labor market identified drivers </p><p>of increasing slack that would lead to slowing job gains while the </p><p>unemployment remains low. We continue to forecast an unemployment rate </p><p>of 4.0% in 4Q23 and 4.4% in 4Q24. </p><p>The housing correction has bottomed, the recovery has begun.  Last year </p><p>our housing strategists called for a bottom in the housing correction in 2Q23, </p><p>followed by an L-shape recovery. After 8 straight quarters of decline, we are </p><p>tracking a turn upward in residential investment in 2Q23 at an annualized </p><p>pace of 0.3%. </p><p>We continue to see the peak federal funds rate at 5.375% this year, first </p><p>cut in March 2024.  Though our revisions to GDP growth suggest the </p><p>economy is not tracking soft enough for disinflationary pressures and labor </p><p>market slack to build more quickly, core inflation and job creation are moving </p><p>in the right direction. We think this backdrop supports our expectation that </p><p>policy remains on hold for an extended period to allow the policy stance to </p><p>become more restrictive over time as inflation recedes. </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Where We've Been Wrong </p><p>The economy in the first half of the year is growing much stronger than we had </p><p>anticipated, putting a more comfortable cushion under our long-held soft landing </p><p>view.  Following 1Q23 GDP clocking an annualized pace of  2.0%, we are currently tracking </p><p>2Q23 GDP at 1.8%. On balance, the first half of 2023 looks set to average 1.9% growth vs. </p><p>0.5% previously forecasted in our mid-year outlook. The stronger-than-expected growth in </p><p>1H23 is no fluke, we have raised our GDP forecasts in the second half, and full year 2023. </p><p>The narrative behind the numbers tells the story of  industrial strength in the US. </p><p>We have raised our forecast for real GDP by 0.9pp to 1.3% 4Q/4Q in 2023 and by 0.1pp </p><p>to 1.4% in 2024 . Some of our adjustments represent a mark-to-market, for sizable upward </p><p>revisions the BEA made to 1Q23 GDP, which added 0.2pp to our 2023 GDP growth </p><p>forecast. New assumptions around non-residential structures investment made a sizable </p><p>0.3pp contribution. Also contributing to the GDP forecast revision is state & local </p><p>investment, which is stronger than expected from increased public investment in </p><p>infrastructure. See Forecast Summary for more detail. In this note we will focus on these </p><p>two components where our assumptions have changed. </p><p>Exhibit 1: </p><p>Non-Residential Structures Investment </p><p>We have raised our forecast for non-resi structures investment by 9.7pp to 12.9% </p><p>4Q/4Q in 2023 and by 4.8pp to 1.9% in 2024. </p><p>Business fixed investment is comprised of three major components, by size - equipment, </p><p>non-residential structures, and intellectual property products (IPP). Exhibit 2   portrays </p><p>our forecast for business investment and its components. </p><p>Exhibit 1   provides our GDP forecast with contributions from its components.

The 3-month moving average in the </p><p>MSBCI Capex Plans Index  has also declined. The latest data show that  core capital goods </p><p>shipments rose solidly in April and May, and in May, orders bounced back above shipments </p><p>for the first time in seven months. The trade deficit in capital goods has narrowed </p><p>somewhat, which implies more of the capital goods shipments are going to export, </p><p>nevertheless  on net we see less slowing in equipment investment in 2Q (tracking an </p><p>annualized -2.5%) than in 1Q (-8.9%). We forecast business investment to be in decline </p><p>through 1Q24. </p><p>Non-residential structures investment is rebounding, led by manufacturing, increasing </p><p>by a double-digit annualized pace in 4Q22 and 1Q23.  In 1Q23, a rise in mining </p><p>exploration, shafts, and wells also contributed.  Manufacturing construction has shown </p><p>broad strength, with nominal construction spending for "computer, electronic, and </p><p>electrical" up 235% in the twelve months through May, and other manufacturing spending </p><p>up 7%. </p><p>Moderating construction costs have provided a lift to real structures investment , with </p><p>prices rising at an 8.6% annual rate in 1Q - elevated, but only about half the pace of the </p><p>prior four quarters. Price data for 2Q show further slowing. We are tracking a significant </p><p>acceleration in non-residential structures investment in 2Q - a whopping 27.7% </p><p>annualized pace (the strongest quarter in more than a decade). To be fair,  monthly </p><p>business construction spending data can be significantly revised, but the persistent </p><p>strength in nominal manufacturing construction and the further help from slowing </p><p>inflation suggest another strong quarter. </p><p>Structures are a persistent component of GDP, in other words, investment tends to be </p><p>elevated for some time after construction projects start. But, on the other hand, </p><p>investment growth is highly pro-cyclical and we think a slowdown in economic activity due </p><p>to tight financial conditions will cause deceleration in structures from 3Q23 on. </p><p>Exhibit 2: Non-residential structures leads with double-digit rebound in 2023  </p><img src=".\results\fig_1.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p> The time to build is the primary </p><p>determinant of how quickly direct short-run effects show up in GDP.  </p><p> The knock </p><p>on effects occur in both the short, and long run.    </p><p>Not only is infrastructure a high-multiplier fiscal spending category, it is also one that </p><p>has been persistently below trend for more than a decade    </p><p> a significant component of the shortfall has </p><p>been in the "economic affairs" category of government spending by function, which </p><p>includes transportation highways, air, water, transit and railroad, space and "other </p><p>economic affairs."  </p><p> </p><p>Exhibit 3: Government investment has been running below  </p><img src=".\results\fig_2.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 4: </p><img src=".\results\fig_3.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p> We have assumed spending continues into 2024, but the uplift to </p><p>potential growth and productivity could last much longer. </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Exhibit 5: </p><p>Note #1:  </p><p>Note #2:  </p><p>====================================================================================================</p></body></html>
