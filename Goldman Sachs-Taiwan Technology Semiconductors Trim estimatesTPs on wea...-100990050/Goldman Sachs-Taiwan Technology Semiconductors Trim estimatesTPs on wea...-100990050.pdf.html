<html><body><p>Taiwan Technology: Semiconductors Trim estimates/TPs on weaker inventory replenishment demand in 2H23; Buy TSMC/UMC, Neutral on MediaTek </p><p>Anticipating a weaker demand recovery in 2H23 We are trimming our forecasts for TSMC, UMC and MediaTek mainly to reﬂect weaker than expected demand recovery in 2H23. While our key viewpoint remains unchanged that 1H23 will be the industry bottom followed by a demand recovery in 2H23, the momentum of demand resumption in 2H23 could be weaker than our earlier expectation, especially in PC and smartphone markets as our industry checks indicate customers are still conservative on inventory build. </p><p>Inventory correction cycle likely to last for longer For PC, although the stabilization of sell-through has translated to the reducing trend of inventory dollar for PC OEM/ODM since 2Q22 (see Exhibit 1), we see still lackluster inventory replenishment momentum from brand customers as they maintain a conservative stance on inventory control with a low conﬁdence level in inventory build. We believe this will also be impacted by ongoing macro uncertainties. As for smartphone, the industry dynamic looks similar to the PC market, according to our checks. Moreover, we did not see any meaningful new AI demand fulﬁlling utilization rate at TSMC as of now. </p><p>Overall speaking, we now believe the industry-wide inventory correction cycle is  </p><p>sell-through, and for inventory to normalize for those companies with higher PC/smartphone exposure.

We are now looking for 12-inch capacity UTR in 2H23 to be at 93-95% level (from 95-100%) for TSMC, and lower at 85-90% (from 88-97%) for UMC in 2H23. Furthermore, in light of slowing demand and UTR recovery, we see high possibility for a slowdown in capex spending for foundry names. Therefore, we cut our capex forecasts for both TSMC and UMC. For TSMC, we lower our 2023/2024E capex to US$32bn/US$36bn </p><p>Goldman Sachs does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports.

Net net, we reiterate our Buy rating for TSMC and UMC, Neutral rating for MediaTek; with TP cut to NT$675 (from NT$708), NT$62 (from NT$68), and NT$730 (from NT$755), respectively. </p><p>Exhibit 1: The PC OEM/ODMs continue to make progress in drawing  down inventory  </p><img src=".\results\fig_0.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 2: GS house view expects a 15% yoy decline in the PC TAM  </p><img src=".\results\fig_1.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 3: Handset OEM inventory decreased 5% sequentially vs  </p><img src=".\results\fig_2.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 4: Handset OEM DOI of 40 days was above typical  </p><img src=".\results\fig_3.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Company outlooks and earnings revision </p><p>TSMC (2330.TW) </p><p>Weaker near term momentum especially for 7nm We cut our 2023/2024/2025E estimates by 6.2%/4.6%/1.4% respectively, mainly as we reﬂect the weaker demand recovery in 2H23. We have lowered our 12-inch UTR for TSMC, and now look for UTR in 2H23 to be at the 93-95% level (from 95-100% previously). Speciﬁcally, we see a deeper cut at 7nm given a slower sell-in and </p><p>customers’ conservative stance towards inventory control. We now forecast UTR for 7nm to be ~55% in 2H23 (vs 65-75% previously, and 45-50% in 1H23), dragged by the lukewarm order momentum from smartphone. </p><p>On capex, in light of the weaker demand and slower UTR recovery, we trim TSMC’s 2023/2024/2025E capex to US$32bn/US$36bn/US$40bn (from US$33bn/US$42bn/US$44bn previously). </p><p>We are now looking for a revenue decline in 2023 Post our downward earnings revisions, we are now looking for a 2.6% YoY revenue (in  </p><p>After a stellar year of revenue growth of 33.3% in 2022, we now expect revenue in 2023E to be down by 4.1% (vs +0.2% YoY previously), before a strong rebound in 2024E of 27.2% (all in USD terms).

We are now looking for its 12-inch capacity UTR in 2H23 to lower to 85-90% (from 88-97% previously and 80-82% in 1H23). The magnitude of UTR recovery in 2H23 for its 8-inch capacity will also lower to ~60% (vs 80-85% previously, and vs 55-58% in 1H23). </p><p>Furthermore, on capacity expansion, due to the slowing demand and UTR recovery, we believe it is very likely for UMC to push out its current expansion projects; for instance, for its P6 and Singapore expansion by 1-2 quarters. Accordingly, we lower its capex for 2023/2024E to US$2.4bn/US$2.2bn (from US$2.5bn/US$2.5bn previously). </p><p>Weaker 2023 outlook, but the rebound in 2024 should remain strong Post our downward earnings revisions, we are now looking for a 12.3% YoY revenue (in USD term) decline in 2H23, vs a 3.4% YoY decrease previously, and a 24.3% YoY drop in 1H23. </p><p>Exhibit 6: TSMC’s revenue growth outlook  </p><img src=".\results\fig_5.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 7: TSMC’s margin trend  </p><img src=".\results\fig_6.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 8: Capex forecast revisions (US$bn)  </p><img src=".\results\fig_7.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 9: TSMC capex trend  </p><img src=".\results\fig_8.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Exhibit 10: Earnings revisions - UMC  </p><img src=".\results\fig_9.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 11: UMC’s revenue and margin trends  </p><img src=".\results\fig_10.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 12: UMC’s blended UTR for 8-inch/12-inch  </p><img src=".\results\fig_11.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 13: UMC capex forecast revisions (US$bn)  </p><img src=".\results\fig_12.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 14: UMC capex trend (US$bn)  </p><img src=".\results\fig_13.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>MediaTek (2454.TW) </p><p>Expecting a weaker restocking demand from customers in 2H23        </p><p>A slower 2H23 recovery     </p><p>Exhibit 15: Earnings revisions - MediaTek  </p><img src=".\results\fig_14.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Exhibit 16: MediaTek’s revenue growth outlook  </p><img src=".\results\fig_15.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 17: MediaTek’s margin trend  </p><img src=".\results\fig_16.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 18: MediaTek’s smartphone shipment mix  </p><img src=".\results\fig_17.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 19: MediaTek’s smartphone revenue mix vs mobile GM  </p><img src=".\results\fig_18.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>TSMC (2330.TW Buy, TP to NT$675 from NT$708; ADR to US$110 from US$115) </p><p>Reiterate Buy; ﬁne tune TP to NT$675 from NT$708     </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Key downside risks to our views:       </p><p>UMC (2303.TW, Buy, TP to NT$62 from NT$68; ADR to US$10.2 from US$11.1) </p><p>Exhibit 20: Taiex vs. TSMC  </p><img src=".\results\fig_19.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 21: Forward P/E  </p><img src=".\results\fig_20.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Maintain Buy; cut TP to NT$62 from NT$68     </p><p>Key downside risks to our views:  </p><p>Exhibit 22: Taiex vs. UMC  </p><img src=".\results\fig_21.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 23: Forward P/E  </p><img src=".\results\fig_22.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>MediaTek (2454.TW, Neutral, TP to NT$730 from NT$755) </p><p>Remain Neutral; cut TP to NT$730 from NT$755   </p><p>Key risks to our views:     </p><p>Exhibit 24: Taiex vs. MediaTek  </p><img src=".\results\fig_23.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Exhibit 25: Forward P/E  </p><img src=".\results\fig_24.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Investment Thesis - TSMC (2330.TW/TSM)            </p><p>Price Target Risks and Methodology - TSMC (2330.TW/TSM) Valuation:     </p><p>Key downside risks to our views:       </p><p>Investment Thesis  - UMC (2303.TW/UMC)     </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Price Target Risks and Methodology - UMC (2303.TW/UMC) Valuation:     </p><p>Key downside risks to our views:    </p><p>Investment Thesis - MediaTek (2454.TW)      </p><p>Price Target Risks and Methodology Valuation:   </p><p>Key risks to our views:         </p><p>====================================================================================================</p></body></html>
