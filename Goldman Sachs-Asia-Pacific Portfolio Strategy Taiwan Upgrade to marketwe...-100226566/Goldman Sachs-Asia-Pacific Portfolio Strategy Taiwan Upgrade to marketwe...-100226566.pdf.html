<html><body><p>Asia-Paciﬁc Portfolio Strategy </p><p>Taiwan: Upgrade to marketweight; position for a cyclical recovery </p><p>With a northward shift in our regional allocation for 2023, we also upgrade Taiwan to Marketweight , due to (1) positive trade exposure to China’s reopening, (2) high exposure to global and US growth, where recession risks appear to be falling, (3) a potential return of foreign ﬂows on peaking US rates and a weaker dollar, (4) still elevated but moderating China geopolitical risks, and (5) a strong tech cycle recovery in 2H, despite still challenging near-term earnings outlook and subdued domestic growth in 2023/24. We forecast a 16,200 TAIEX target by end-2023 (up from 14,700), implying 8% price return, riding on forward earnings recovery. </p><p>Performance: Taiwan equities had a strong start (+8%) in 2023 led by semis & ﬁns after the worst performing year since the GFC (down 25%/32% in LOC/USD). </p><p>Macro:  China reopening to boost regional growth, beneﬁting exporters but direct net impact to Taiwan macro could be less due to higher oil; DM growth to improve with moderating recession risks; Policy rates to peak in May but the Fed cuts may not happen until 2Q24; Below-potential Taiwan’s economic growth, as exports and ﬁxed investment remain weak in 1H; Cross-strait risk moderated from elevated levels while the market appears to have fairly priced the uncertainty; Municipal election results (KMT’s victory) tended to support Taiwan equities in next 12 months. </p><p>Valuations:  Fair fPE valuations (13.5X, 10-yr mean); attractive tP/B (2.0X on 16% ROE) relative to South Asian markets; favorable (4%) dividend yields. </p><p>Earnings:  Near-term earnings remain challenged due to weak end-demand; forecast -20%/+25% growth in 2023/24 (-6pp/+11pp vs. prior) with a stronger 2H recovery. </p><p>Flows & positioning:  A strong return of foreign ﬂows since Nov (+US$8.5bn) after record outﬂows (-US$80bn) in 3 years which pushed the foreign ownership of tech/ﬁnancials to the low end of historical ranges; Global/GEM funds are heavily underweight Taiwan (-150bp/-290bp); Domestic retail activities moderated but are still strong among the region; Government ﬂows provided sentimental support. </p><p>Selective sector preference: Prefer cyclical over defensives, insurance over banks, materials over energy, automation over shipping/airlines, and select tech businesses (leading edge foundry, power semis, EV outsourcing, ABF, MLCC and CCL). </p><p>Implementation ideas:  (1) China reopening beneﬁciaries, (2) Growth recovery with GARP, (3) GS Buy-rated ideas in preferred sectors, and (4) Return of foreign ﬂows. </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Asia-Paciﬁc Portfolio Strategy </p><p>Table of
