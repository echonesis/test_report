While AI servers have been gathering momentum with supply constraints, this is not enough to offset the regular server spending cuts. We see a mild recovery of upstream server components in 3Q and expect a stronger rebound in downstream server shipments in 4Q. For PCs, our thesis of 2Q restocking has played out, with a better-than- expected production build (NB ODM up ~10% QoQ) and sell-in demand. Still, end demand remains muted, with limited visibility into 2H23, implying a likely pause in PC component procurement in late 2Q/early 3Q. We forecast 15% HoH PC shipment growth in 2H on seasonality, but trim full-year shipments to -12% from -10% previously. In the server space, we like Quanta (better AI positioning, link ), ASPEED  (tripled TAM story), EMC (server/switch spec upgrade and share gain) and DRAM makers. In the PC space, we stay OW on Lenovo  and ASMedia , but are more cautious on Realtek . See our global PC and server model here . </p><p>• Servers: AI server undersupply, regular servers underwhelming. We forecast 54% AI server shipment growth this year, with supply constraints across CoWoS (at TSMC) and GPU module packaging (at FII). The initial 2024 AI server order outlook appears to be +50-100% YoY, with potential double- booking. We believe hyperscalers and AI research platforms are building the install base of AI training servers and plan to launch several end applications in 2024. In contrast, regular server demand remains soft, with continued component inventory destocking. We attribute the weakness to macro headwinds and enterprise IT budget cuts. Overall, we model 10% YoY server shipment declines this year, but anticipate a 4% rebound next year. </p><p>• PCs: Strong 2Q restocking demand, mixed 2H23 outlook amid macro headwinds.  Most NB ODM vendors have revised up 2Q build forecasts after robust May shipments (+23% MoM). The latest 2Q NB build appears to be up 9% QoQ (14% YoY decline), above JPMe at +7%, driven by a new product cycle and Chromebook rush orders. However, PC OEM feedback remains mixed about 2H23, as sell-through shipments are still down at mid-teens YoY in 2Q. Therefore, we trim our 2023 PC shipment forecast to -12% YoY. Looking into 2024. we expect the PC market to grow 6% on resumed replacement demand and a new Microsoft product cycle (Win 11). </p><p>• VGA/motherboard: Price discounts despite NVIDIA’s GPU supply control, upcoming RTX4060/50  the key watchpoints. We estimate mid- to high-single-digit QoQ VGA shipment declines in 2Q, as NVIDIA has controlled the GPU supply and end demand was also lackluster. VGA retail prices have come down ~10% on a like-to-like basis in the last few months, but we believe channel VGA vendors could enjoy better product mix and margins. We expect stronger VGA momentum in 3Q23 along with RTX4060/50 launch. For motherboards, we saw strong restocking demand in May and forecast a seasonal trend in 2Q/3Q. Overall, we forecast a high-single-digit decline/slight growth in VGA/MB shipments this year. </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Key changes to our PC and server estimates </p><p>We update our global PC and server model, with key highlights below: </p><p>• We cut our 2023 PC shipment forecast (including Chromebook) to -12% from -10%  incremental weakness across consumer and commercial segments amid the macro headwinds. </p><p>• We forecast commercial PC shipments at -9% in 2023 (similar to our previous estimate), better than consumer PC shipments at -17% (down from -9% previously), given the inflation pressure and channel inventory digestion. </p><p>• We expect PC shipments to rebound 6% in 2024 on replacement demand and improving economics and be back to pre-pandemic levels of ~275mn-280mn units in 2025. </p><p>• We lower our server unit growth forecast to -10% in 2023 (from -5%) to reflect the recent server order cuts across the board, regular cloud server spending push-out for AI investment, and lackluster economic outlook. </p><p>• We expect server shipments to rebound 4% in 2024 on improving macro, resilient growth of ISPs’ core business and a continued digitalization trend.
