<html><body><p>a b </p><p>Global Strategy EM's great monetary divergence – what does it mean for markets? </p><p>What can 10 EM countries' easing cycles over 20y tell us about the next 6m?  GBI and MSCI weighted EM inflation now stand at just 2.5% and 2.2% respectively (3m saar). Core inflation in early hikers such as Mexico, Chile and Czechia has sequentially already landed back inside CB’s tolerance bands (for headline). High ex ante real rates, sluggish growth, low FX volatility and tightening fiscal balances in much of EM give grounds for easing ahead of the Fed - a dynamic that may not be fully priced in.  In this note we examine 10 countries’ rate cutting cycles over 2 decades to understand how different assets historically reacted when EM monetary policy began to diverge from the Fed and the macro conditions that underpinned these moves.  See page 2  for our key conclusions. </p><p>Key questions addressed in this note: </p><p>- When historically has EM diverged from the Fed? - How do today's real rates, current accounts and export growth compare to those cycles? - How have EM assets historically performed in the first 6m of monetary divergence? - Which effect dominates EM FX: carry erosion or stronger portfolio inflow? And what  - Which growth sensitive asset class does better - FX or equities? - Should one allocate more to equities or debt? - Is there still value in local debt? </p><p>Global Research and Evidence Lab </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Executive Summary </p><p>We see 4 key lessons from history, and outline our interpretation for markets today. </p><p>1) It’s not unusual for EM to get ahead of the Fed.  UBS economists expect the first Fed rate cut in December (market pricing: May 2024), but for central banks in Brazil , Mexico , Czech , Hungary , Poland , and Indonesia  easing before this. ( Chile  kickstarted its campaign on Friday with a 100bp cut). In this note we look back at prior EM cycles over the last 20 years, focussing on periods when EM eased amid unchanged or higher Fed policy rates. There have been several such instances in the past: Brazil (2005, 2011 and  </p><p>2) FX typically struggled. But exports & risk premia appear more important drivers than rates.  Average spot EM FX returns were, on average, -0.7% 6m after the start of "early" EM easing cycles. So, the negative FX impact from early easing (carry reduction, reduced incentives to borrow in hard currency /  to repatriate FX into local currency) generally offset the positives (stronger support for debt/equity inflows). However this aggregate result masks key variation. There have been numerous cycles in which EM FX performed well in spite of EM diverging from the Fed (e.g. ZAR in H2-17, BRL in late 2016, CZK and KRW in H2-2012, MXN in H2-2005) Common to these periods were either a) global risk appetite recovering from deeply depressed levels, or b) y/y exports growing in double digits. High rates weren't always a guarantor of strong FX returns e.g. BRL in Sept 2011 (with 12.5% policy rates but sharply slowing export growth), or the IDR (in mid-2006 amid external tightening risk conditions). Currencies that fared particularly poorly (e.g. CLP in late 2013, INR in 2012, PLN in 2005), were those  experiencing notable export growth slowdowns and, in some cases, 3%/ GDP or higher current account deficits. </p><p>3) EM equities posted strong average returns; particularly when export growth crossed 10%. EM equities historically saw strong and front-loaded equity returns (average: 7% local ccy returns) in the first 6m following the first "early" rate cut of the cycle, and moderately outperformed DM. This return profile improves to 11.7% outright, and +4% relative returns vs. DM when two large but idiosyncratic drawdowns (Mexico and Chile in 2013) are excluded. (Note that EM FX returns only improve to +0.5% when these 2 phases are excluded). Returns were often higher when export growth was above 10% y/y; this was  a more reliable barometer of performance than valuation starting points. </p><p>4) Bond yields continued to fall post the onset of easing; giving equities strong competition. Excluding the two 2013 drawdowns mentioned above, EM 10y local bond yields fell 80bp on average in the 6m after "early" EM easing began. Equating to total returns of c.8-9%, returns were thus very similar to EM equities. Given this asset class' greater defensive characteristics, this indicates that investors need not make a wholesale shift from fixed income to equities, despite the former's outperformance so far this year. 10y CDS spreads fell less, by 43bp, indicating outperformance of local over HC debt. </p><p> Market implications </p><p>FX: Wait for Fed cuts to buy EM FX. Buy puts in CEE3 . In recent weeks markets have struggled to digest increasingly dovish pricing in CLP, CZK and HUF despite a benign external environment. With risk appetite elevated (UBS EM Risk Appetite Index is 0.95 s.d. above neutral) and EM export growth still facing challenges , we think this could be a template for the asset class as a whole in the coming months as easing cycles gain steam. We prefer intra-EM RV, seeing greater upside potential in other asset classes. By market we see risks of stronger CEE FX underperformance and recommend buying a basket of 3m EUR/CEE (CZK, HUF, PLN) 25d calls : domestic demand remains anaemic and real rate buffers are far thinner than Latam; exports should slow/underperform in Q4 amid signs of oversupply in European autos; and deeper easing could catalyse redenomination of FX borrowing into local currency at the margin -  note the large pickup in Czech corporate FX lending  and Hungarian external debt  post Covid. We also tighten stops on long PLNCZK to 5.35  to preserve gains. Our preferred FX carry longs remain BRL & COP amid signs of China cyclically basing and potential for commodity catch-up gains; our economists also see a slightly slower BCB easing cycle into YE than markets. We see CLP underperforming  (retain long COPCLP) amid strong Chile FX intervention, a persistently weak external position, sharp rise in FX lending, and fading Treasury FX sales. We prefer to avoid MXN longs (long BRLMXN), seeing more upside potential in rates than FX if Banxico moves to cut in September. </p><p>Equities: Buy 3m upside optionality in China, Brazil & S Africa . Risk/reward > FX . While our baseline is for moderate returns of 1070 for MSCI EM at YE, risk/reward for this asset class appears to be improving as China cyclically accelerates while discount rates increasingly fall. While broad EM risk appetite is high, the equity subcomponents of our EM RAI are where the bulk of the drag comes from today e.g. MSCI EM/World levels and relative PE ratios. The delivery of stronger EM monetary easing in the coming months could help catalyse tactical catch up gains via valuation re-rating in markets with high equity risk premia. We favour owning a basket of 3m call options in MSCI China, Brazil & S Africa on the basis of falling bond yields and exposure to an improving near term China outlook. </p><p>Fixed income: Still attractive risk/reward, but not in  China . Stay OW local, FX hedged over HC debt for now. Local rates have already enjoyed a strong rally this year, with powerful easing now priced into Latam and CEEMEA curves. The bar for big gains is higher now, absent a US recession, but - as detailed in a recent note  - our inflation forecasts do still imply favourable risk/reward in several markets. We prefer Czech (10y), Korea (10y) and S Africa (3y) FX hedged bonds, as well as 2-3y swaps in Brazil and Mexico.  By contrast we see stronger risk/reward over the next 3-4m in paying, rather than receiving, China rates. We  dislike the belly in Poland vs Europe/CZ/HU, and are tactically cautious on front ends in India and Thailand. </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>moving total, % of GDP.
