The pace of disinflation could surprise in '23. </p><p>Having peaked higher and persisted for longer than most expected, inflation is finally rolling over fast. From here, we think the pace of disinflation will also be faster than markets expect. Inflation-breakevens are pricing 2.5% and 2.3% y/y US CPI for Dec ’23 and Dec’24, respectively. Our expectations are lower at 2.2%  and 1.7%. Continuing our prior work on stagflation  and slowflation , we now present a new quantitative framework that shows how the pace of disinflation impacts assets. We provide lists of stocks  best suited to position for disinflation in the US, EU, UK, APAC and LatAm. We also quantify the probabilities equity markets imply of inflation reaching different thresholds (including central bank targets) by end '23 and end '24. </p><p>What will drive disinflation this year? </p><p>Supply bottlenecks  have fully eased, core goods prices are coming lower, oil and natural gas prices have underperformed their forwards, and the marginal rental leases are being negotiated at much lower rates. Our real time measures show the labour market is weaker than headline payroll or vacancies suggest.  Europe's inflation surge has been driven largely by energy. Although HICP  inflation will only reach the ECB's 2% target in 2025, disinflation will be the dominant theme between now and then. China is the exception where inflation is likely to rise temporarily to 3% in '23 before dropping back to 2.1% in '24. More broadly, in APAC, disinflation will still be the dominant theme in '23. </p><p>How to position for a disinflation regime? </p><p>We have designed a quantitative framework to screen for stocks that are positioned to benefit in a disinflationary environment. Leveraging our local and global inflation indexes, we select the stocks most positively/negatively impacted by disinflation in the US, Europe, UK, APAC and LatAm based on: (1) return sensitivity to changes in our inflation indexes, (2) price performance during periods of declining inflation, and (3) sensitivity of revenues to changes in our inflation indexes. Using this bottom-up analysis we get the following implied industry/sector-level picture: </p><p>1. Overweights : Health Care, Tech, Comm. Services and Cons. Discretionary </p><p>Consumer Discretionary, Health Care and Communication Services have empirically overperformed other sectors during periods of declining inflation, and have exhibited the lowest beta to inflation changes. Tech and Health Care expected revenues are the least positively correlated with the change in our inflation indexes. </p><p>2. Underweights : Energy, Industrials and Financials </p><p>Unsurprisingly, Energy consistently ranked the worst across the 4 regions. Financials and Industrials also score poorly (almost always in the bottom half) on all 3 metrics. Materials is another potential candidate for underweight, especially in Europe and Apac. </p><p>What probability do markets ascribe to being back at central bank targets? </p><p>Currently, S&P500 internals are pricing in an 8% and 16% probability of inflation being at central bank target  by Dec '23 and Dec '24. European and UK companies are pricing even lower probabilities, at 5% and 11% for Europe and 4% and 8% for UK, while Asian companies are pricing the highest probabilities, at 26% and 38%. In LatAm countries, CPIs have started to decline since Q2, earlier than developed countries, explaining the current pricing, at 10% and 20%. We expect most central bank targets will be hit in 2023 itself. Results from backtesting suggest our lists of stocks most impacted by disinflation could outperform. </p><p>This report has been prepared by UBS Europe SE. ANALYST CERTIFICATION AND REQUIRED DISCLOSURES, including information on the Quantitative Research Review published by UBS, begin on page 36. </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>How this note is laid out </p><p>As an introduction, we go back through the whole inflation journey which started with Stagflation fears in Q1'22, then moved to a less uncomfortable Slowflation set-up in H2'22, to end  with Disinflation in 2023. We also highlight why it is important to distinguish supply shock to demand shock.  Then,  in Part I, we lay out our methodology to construct stocks lists that should outperform (underperform) in a disinflationary environment, giving investors a liquid way to play the theme. In Part II, we calculate the probabilities the equity market implies for inflation reaching a given level over a given horizon. In Part III, our economic team shares their inflation views  per region, highlighting the most recent dynamics and the key data and key drivers to watch. </p><p>1. Executive Summary in Few Charts 2.
