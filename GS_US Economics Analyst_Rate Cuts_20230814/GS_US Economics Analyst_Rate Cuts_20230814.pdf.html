<html><body><p>US Economics Analyst Rate Cuts (Mericle) </p><ul><li>Our baseline forecast calls for the FOMC to start cutting the funds rate in 2024Q2.  At that point, we expect core PCE inﬂation to have fallen below 3% year-on-year and below 2.5% on a monthly annualized basis.  The motivation for cutting outside of a recession would be to normalize the funds rate from a restrictive level back toward neutral once inﬂation is closer to the target. </li><li>Normalization is not a particularly urgent motivation for cutting, and for that reason we also see a signiﬁcant risk that the FOMC will instead hold steady.  The FOMC might not cut because inﬂation might not fall enough or, even if it does, because solid growth, a tight labor market, and a further easing of ﬁnancial conditions might make cutting seem like an unnecessary risk. </li><li>Some Fed ofﬁcials and investors argue that the FOMC must cut as inﬂation falls to prevent real interest rates from rising and hurting the economy.  We disagree with this logic.  Real interest rates should be calculated by subtracting off forward-looking inﬂation expectations, not realized inﬂation, and inﬂation expectations have already fallen to or nearly to target-consistent levels. Moreover, adjusting our broader ﬁnancial conditions index (FCI) for inﬂation rather than the funds rate has very little impact on the implied impulse to GDP growth, which is now modest. </li><li>We are penciling in 25bp of cuts per quarter but are uncertain about the pace. The FOMC might move slowly if its desire to normalize is only lukewarm and it fears further boosting asset prices and strengthening an economy with an already-tight labor market, or it could cut more quickly from a high starting point if it is more conﬁdent that the inﬂation problem is unlikely to return. </li><li>We expect the funds rate to eventually stabilize at 3-3.25%, above the FOMC’s 2.5% median longer run dot.  We have long been skeptical that neutral was as low as widely thought last cycle, and larger ﬁscal deﬁcits have arguably pushed it higher since.  Fed ofﬁcials could raise their longer run dots if the economy remains resilient with the funds rate at a much higher level or they could conclude—as a recent New York Fed blog post did—that the short-run neutral rate is elevated. </li><li>Our views have been more hawkish than market pricing this year because we have seen both a lower probability of recession than consensus and a relatively high threshold for rate cuts.  This remains true, though the gap has narrowed as </li></ul><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>recessions fears have faded.  We think it is appropriate for the yield curve to be inverted, but not quite as much as it is. </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Rate Cuts </p><p>The soft July CPI report and dovish comments from New York Fed President John Williams this week supported our view that the FOMC is likely to skip a rate hike at the September meeting and ultimately decide in November that the core inﬂation trend has slowed enough to make a ﬁnal hike unnecessary. </p><p>In this week’s Analyst , we discuss our views on possible rate cuts next year.  Our baseline forecast calls for cuts to start in 2024Q2, proceed at 25bp per quarter, and end at 3-3.25%.  But we do not see a strong need to cut and consequently we think there is a signiﬁcant risk that the FOMC will instead hold steady. </p><p>Question 1: What would cause the FOMC to cut? </p><p>The FOMC could cut for any of three reasons: a recession, a moderate growth scare, or </p><p>a convincing decline in inﬂation.  We have long seen a high threshold for cutting because Fed ofﬁcials will want to minimize the risk that they could regret cutting if inﬂation stays too high.  Last year we initially took the view that the FOMC was unlikely to cut until a growth scare emerged, but we softened our stance earlier this year and have since assumed that a convincing decline in inﬂation would probably be enough to prompt cuts.  We made this change in part because Fed ofﬁcials increasingly emphasized that once inﬂation came down, it would no longer be necessary or appropriate to keep the funds rate so high relative to estimates of the neutral rate.  The cuts in our forecast are driven by this desire to normalize the funds rate from a restrictive level once inﬂation is closer to target, not by a recession. </p><p>Exhibit 1: The Latest Inﬂation Data Support Our Expectation That the Core Trend Will Have Slowed Enough  by November for the FOMC to Conclude That a Final Hike Is Unnecessary  </p><img src="./results/fig_0.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Question 2: When will the FOMC deliver the ﬁrst rate cut? </p><p>We expect the ﬁrst rate cut in 2024Q2.  By that point, we expect core PCE inﬂation to have fallen below 3% on a year-on-year basis and below 2.5% on a monthly annualized basis, and wage growth to have fallen below 4% year-on-year.  Those thresholds for cutting align roughly with the annual forecasts in the FOMC’s Summary of Economic Projections and the conditions at the outset of the last cutting cycle motivated by an intent to normalize from a restrictive policy stance as inﬂation came down in 1995. </p><p>Exhibit 2: Our Baseline Forecast Calls for Rate Cuts Without a Recession Because Once Inﬂation Comes  Down, the Funds Rate Will Not Need to Remain High Relative to Recent History and Estimates of Neutral  </p><img src="./results/fig_1.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Question 3: How conﬁdent are you that the FOMC will cut next year? </p><p>Exhibit 3: We Expect the First Cut in 2024Q2 with Core PCE Inﬂation Below 3% YoY and 2.5% MoM  Annualized, Similar to the Starting Conditions of the Last Cycle of Normalization Cuts  </p><img src="./results/fig_2.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Question 4: But doesn’t the FOMC have to cut the funds rate as inﬂation falls to prevent the real funds rate from rising and weakening the economy? </p><p>Exhibit 4: Inﬂation Expectations Have Already Normalized Most of the Way to Target-Consistent Levels, Meaning That There Is Little Room  for a Further Decline to Boost Real Rates  </p><img src="./results/fig_3.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Exhibit 5: Adjusting Our Financial Conditions Index for Inﬂation Does Not Change the Implied Impulse to GDP Growth by Much  </p><img src="./results/fig_4.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Question 5: How quickly will the FOMC cut interest rates? </p><p>Exhibit 6: Fed Ofﬁcials Have Put Different Degrees of Emphasis on the Real Fed Funds Rate Over Time  </p><img src="./results/fig_5.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Question 6: At what terminal rate will the cutting cycle end? </p><p>Exhibit 7: We Have Penciled in 25bp of Cuts Per Quarter but Are Uncertain About the Pace and Would  Expect It to Be Faster If a Growth Scare or a Recession Arises  </p><img src="./results/fig_6.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Question 7: What do your views imply about the front end of the yield curve? </p><p>Exhibit 8: We Expect the Funds Rate to Stabilize at 3-3.25%, Not the FOMC’s 2.5% Longer Run Estimate, in  Part Because We Think Neutral Is Higher Than Was Widely Thought Last Cycle  </p><img src="./results/fig_7.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>David Mericle  </p><p>Exhibit 9: Our Views Remain a Bit More Hawkish Than Market Pricing on a Like-to-Like Probability-Weighted Basis, Though the Gap Has  Narrowed as Recession Fears Have Diminished  </p><img src="./results/fig_8.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>The US Economic and Financial Outlook  </p><img src="./results/fig_9.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p></body></html>
