While they disagree on who/what is ultimately responsible for the crisis, they generally agree that it was a classic bank run, which Gorton argues is always about runs on short-term debt. The short-term debt at the root of the recent crisis was uninsured deposits, which both catalyzed and exacerbated the failure of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). </p><p>GS bank analysts Richard Ramsden, Chris Hallam, and Ryan Nash then explain how: as the Fed sharply tightened financial conditions last year to rein in inflation, companies found it more difficult to raise cash, leading to deposit outflows. To meet those outflows, SVB sold long-term Treasuries it held on its balance sheet—the value of which had plummeted as interest rates rose—at a loss. A capital raise to cover those losses failed, and a significant run on deposits occurred, resulting in the largest bank failure since the 2008 financial crisis. These events, they say, prompted a broad migration of deposits from the banking system into money market funds as well as migrating to global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), forcing some banks to source liquidity from the Fed. </p><p>The good news is that this deposit migration and need for emergency funding seems to have slowed in the most recent week—suggesting the situation has stabilized somewhat (see pg. 9). </p><p>But even if that remains the case, what are the implications of the recent events for bank lending, growth, and central bank policy? GS US economists David Mericle and Manuel Abecasis expect small banks, which play an important role in the US economy, to pull back on lending, which they estimate will exert a 0.25-0.5pp drag on growth this year. This, they say, would have the same impact on the economy as roughly 25- 50bp of rate hikes, which means that the Fed may have to tighten less to keep growth below potential and return inflation to target. That said, they continue to expect two more 25bp Fed hikes in May and June, for a terminal rate of 5.25-5.5%. </p><p>But what might happen if inflation proves more stubborn than expected? Indeed, these events have shone a spotlight on the broader conundrum that central banks face when monetary policy goals come into tension with financial stability, as is the case today. GS Head of European Rates Strategy George Cole turns for guidance to European central banks. He finds that central banks tend to be more successful at separating—and achieving—conflicting price and financial stability goals when the nature of the financial stability problem is liquidity rather than solvency. He concludes that banks’ cost of capital has not yet risen sufficiently to reverse the tightening delivered so far, consistent with GS economists’ view that the Fed and ECB will continue hiking (see pg. 25). But he cautions that if higher rates </p><p>Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research  </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>El </p><p>Interview with Daniel K. Tarullo </p><p>Daniel K. Tarullo is a former member of the Federal Reserve Board, serving from 2009-2017. He is currently Nomura Professor of International Financial Regulatory Practice at Harvard Law School. Below, he discusses his views on what was behind the recent bank stresses. </p><p>The views stated herein are those of the interviewee and do not necessarily reflect those of Goldman Sachs. </p><p>adequately follow up to ensure that the bank has taken the appropriate remedial steps. </p><p>Allison Nathan: As former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board’s Committee on Supervision and Regulation in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis, you’ve seen banking crises play out firsthand. Was there anything unusual or different about the recent crisis? </p><p>Based on what we know so far, it seems that the last form of supervisory failure was present to some degree; we know that supervisors at the San Francisco Fed identified some of the very issues that clearly lay at the heart of SVB’s failure. But it appears they may not have followed up quickly enough given the magnitude of the problem and the fast-growing nature of SVB. I also suspect that the effort by the Board of Governors over the past four or five years to relax supervisory oversight contributed to the supervisory failure. </p><p>Allison Nathan: It’s been argued that the 2018 rollback of Dodd-Frank—bill S.2155—that exempted smaller banks from strict federal oversight set the stage for the recent crisis. You opposed that rollback—what’s your view? </p><p>Daniel Tarullo:  In broad terms, this was a textbook bank run; a piece of information—namely, large unrealized losses in Silicon Valley Bank’s (SVB) asset book— generated uncertainty about its health that motivated some depositors to rationally withdraw their money even if the bank may have been solvent, because, from the depositor’s point of view, why take the chance that it wasn’t? And other depositors followed. This scenario is eminently comparable to the 1920/30s, when small depositors saw their fellow depositors lining up outside banks to withdraw their money and joined in. The only difference here is that instead of depositors lining up, venture capitalists used social media and other means to spread the word to their portfolio companies that they should pull their money out of SVB. Today’s technology that allows for rapid communication and the transfer of money with a touch of a button substantially accelerated the speed of the run, but the underlying dynamics were basically the same. </p><p>Daniel Tarullo:  I opposed that bill because I thought it went way too far in raising the threshold for banks that would receive special regulation—the $250bn asset threshold struck me then, and strikes me now, as too high. The bill was based on the false premise that banks with $100-250bn in assets are not as a group systemically important, which recent events have proven untrue. So, the legislation was ill-advised, and may have contributed to a sense that supervisors and regulators should ease up on smaller banks. </p><p>Allison Nathan: What was responsible for the recent crisis? </p><p>That said, I don't see a strong direct connection between S.2155 and SVB’s failure, because the rules and regulations SVB would have been subjected to before S.2155 would not have uncovered its vulnerabilities. Based on prevailing metrics, SVB's capital and liquidity coverage ratios might well have been within the acceptable range. And the stress test that SVB would have been required to participate in a year earlier was a single scenario stress test that posited a reduction  in interest rates, rather than the sharp increase in rates that triggered its troubles. But that's not to say that the supervisory gap is not very problematic and that there may have been a need to change regulations to apply them in a more discriminating way to banks of a particular size. And the Fed had a lot of authority to do that, even under S.2155; it basically chose not to exercise that authority. </p><p>Daniel Tarullo:  In the first instance, the responsibility lies with bank management. From what we know, the liability side of SVB’s balance sheet was mishandled. Beyond that, while a good bit of the story remains to be uncovered, it’s apparent that some sort of supervisory failure occurred. Any time a bank grows fourfold within just a few years, that should be a warning sign to regulators, because rapid growth often outstrips the risk management capacities of the institution. And the piece of information that jumped out at me during the recent Senate Banking hearing was that the top 10 depositors of SVB had an aggregate of $13bn in uninsured deposits. With total deposits of roughly $200bn, it's not a stretch to say that's an anomalous situation, and one that should have been noticed and zeroed in on to understand the vulnerabilities that it created. </p><p>Allison Nathan: So, how would you rate policymakers’ response to the crisis? Was guaranteeing the uninsured deposits of SVB and Signature Bank the right action? </p><p>But it's important to note that the supervisory process can fail in multiple ways. The most obvious way is that a regional Federal Reserve Bank or regional office of the OCC fails to identify risks because they are looking in the wrong place or are too slow to react. The second type of failure is one in which the overall supervisory policies put in place by the agency, in this case the Board of Governors of the Fed, themselves fall short of what's needed, either due to a top-down decision to go a little easy on banks or because the supervisors haven't yet identified new vulnerabilities that the onsite teams need to be looking for. And the final type of failure is one in which the dedicated supervisors identify a problem but fail to quickly and </p><p>Daniel Tarullo:  Answering that question requires some speculation because we, the public, don't have all the granular information that the regulators and other decision-makers had during the weekend following SVB's failure. That said, almost any government of any country, when faced with a burgeoning banking or financial crisis, will take whatever steps are necessary to tamp down that crisis before it becomes full- blown. Those actions may exacerbate the moral hazard problem, which will have to be dealt with after the crisis </p><p>Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research  </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Allison Nathan: How concerned are you that we are at the beginning rather than the end of this crisis? </p><p>Daniel Tarullo:       </p><p>Allison Nathan: Could increasing deposit insurance by raising insured caps, or even guaranteeing all deposits, be a more lasting solution to the recent crisis? </p><p>Daniel Tarullo:                       </p><p>Allison Nathan: What—if any—adjustments to rules and regulations would strengthen the health of the system? </p><p>Daniel Tarullo:               </p><p>Allison Nathan: What—if any—more lasting impacts might the recent events have on the banking industry? </p><p>Daniel Tarullo:                    </p><p>Allison Nathan: As a former member of the Federal Reserve Board, did you agree with the March Fed rate hike? </p><p>Daniel Tarullo:      </p><p>Allison Nathan: How should the Fed weigh inflation risks versus financial stability risks going forward? </p><p>Daniel Tarullo:            </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Allison Nathan: Who/what is responsible for the recent stresses in the US banking sector? </p><p>Thomas Hoenig:                     </p><p>Thomas Hoenig:                       </p><p>Allison Nathan: That said, you’ve called the recent bank failures inevitable given the Dodd-Frank regulatory framework.
