Growth in economic activity over the past three quarters has averaged 2.3%, the unemployment rate has remained near all- time lows, and wage and price pressures are moving in the right direction, albeit gradually. Cyclically sensitive sectors have shown signs of stabilization. </p><p>What’s in: soft landing, no recession </p><p>We revise our outlook for the US economy in favor of a soft landing, where growth falls below trend in 2024, but remains positive throughout our forecast horizon. We forecast US GDP growth of 2.0% (4Q/4Q) this year, 0.7% in 2024, and 1.8% in 2025. This is  </p><p>We still expect inflation to decelerate and remain on a path to 2.0%, but with a stronger forecast for activity and labor markets, inflation falls more gradually. We now have PCE inflation falling to 2.0% y/y in 2H 2025, about two quarters later than in our prior mild recession baseline. The four-quarter change in core PCE inflation is 3.5% in 2023 (unchanged), 2.8% in 2024 (up 0.4pp), and 2.2% in 2025 (up 0.1pp). </p><p>We look for the unemployment rate to rise to a peak of 4.3% in 1Q 2025, versus 4.7% in 4Q 2024 previously. The labor market should continue to cool and employment growth should moderate, but not as much as we forecasted previously. </p><p>A cautiously cutting Fed </p><p>If our outlook proves true, this would be good news for the Fed. We still expect one additional 25bp rate hike in September for a terminal target range of 5.50-5.75%, though it may slip to November. We now expect the first rate cut in June 2024. We also expect balance sheet runoff (quantitative tightening) to end at the same time, though the Fed has mentioned that it may consider letting its balance sheet run off even after the cutting cycle begins, suggesting risks to a longer runoff period. </p><p>The main difference between our new forecast and prior forecast is in the pace of rate cuts, which we now think will come more slowly. We expect quarterly 25bp reductions in  </p><p>Our Fed outlook also stands apart from market expectations of rate cuts. Markets, which must price in distributions of outcomes and not modal paths, are putting low weight on additional rate hikes, but more weight on a rapid cutting cycle should the economy weaken. In recent months prices on federal funds futures contracts have implied somewhere between 120-160bp of rate cuts in 2024. If our outlook proves accurate, many of these rate cuts would be taken out over time. This is consistent with guidance from our US rates strategy team which has encouraged clients to remain underweight the front end and fade the extent of rate cuts early in ’ 24. </p></div></div><div class="column"><div class="content"><h2>Barclays US Economics Revisions to our nearterm outlook 230818</h2><p>US Economics Revisions to our near-term outlook </p><p>With incoming data suggesting a reacceleration in activity in Q4, we are revising up our forecast and postponing the start of a mild downturn to Q2 2024. We maintain our FOMC call for a 25bp increase in the funds rate at the November meeting, and delay our first rate cut to September 2024. </p><p>With indicators of US activity pointing to a reacceleration in Q3, and employment continuing to look resilient through July, we are revising our outlook to show a GDP growth rate that is significantly stronger in Q3 and slightly firmer in Q4.  We maintain our projection of a mild contraction in activity, but postpone the start of a downturn to Q2 2024. The stronger path of activity results in a downward revision to our unemployment rate path in the second half of 2023, but we continue to expect the unemployment rate to rise in 2024, reaching 4.5% by end of that year. The effect of these revisions on inflation is small, with core PCE inflation lifted a tenth in Q4 2023, to 3.6% (y/y).  Given the momentum in economic activity, the very tight labor market and still unacceptably high inflation, we continue to expect the FOMC to further raise the fed funds target range 25bp at the November meeting, to 5.50-5.75%.  We then expect the FOMC to stay on hold for a while, and push out the time of the first rate cut from July to September 2024. We expect the FOMC to cut rates 25bp at each of the last three meetings of 2024. </p><p>Specifically, we are making the following revisions: • </p><p>We are revising Q3 GDP growth upward to 3.0% q/q saar, up 2.0pp from our prior 1.0% forecast. This reflects mainly an upward revision in private consumption growth to 3.0% q/q saar (up 1.5pp from our prior forecast), which took on board signals from the 0.7% m/m surge in July retail sales, which surpassed expectations by a wide margin (Barclays 0.4% m/m; consensus 0.4% m/m). The July print was broad based, even if we estimate that slightly more than half of its increase reflects July's Amazon Prime Day sale, with payback effects likely weighing on August and September prints. Our Q3 forecast revision also reflects the surprisingly strong 1.0% m/m increase in industrial production in July, which was driven not only by the utilities component in the face of a high demand for cooling, but also by above-expectations gains in manufacturing production. In addition, the increase in July housing starts also points to an increase in residential investment in Q3. </p><p>• </p><p>While the bulk of our upward revision in consumer spending takes place in Q3, we are revising up Q4 consumption growth by 50bp, to 0.5% q/q saar. The higher growth is caused by the stronger momentum and positive feedback between the very tight labor market, which we expect to continue to add over 100k jobs per month and to generate solid personal income growth. This, in turn, continues to fuel consumption, hence keeping the labor market tight. In addition, consumers still benefit from strong balance sheets and little fear of losing employment in the face of a low unemployment rate. </p><p>• </p><p>We expect consumption in coming quarters to be dragged down by the resumption of student loan payments and the depletion of past accumulated savings.  We estimate the </p></div></div><div class="column"><div class="content"><h2>Citi US Economics Weekly   Growth and inflation take higher yields in stride 230825</h2><p>US Economics Weekly </p><p>Growth and inflation take higher yields in stride </p><p>CITI'S TAKE </p><p>The US economic expansion has proved more resilient than even our relatively constructive estimates had implied. Rather than meeting expectations for a slowdown, growth has accelerated and broadened away from the services sector. But stronger activity and tight labor markets mean upside risks to inflation are rising. Chair Powell’s comments at Jackson Hole also seemed more attuned to these upside growth and inflation risks. It increasingly appears that longer-term yields sustained at or above current levels will be required to return inflation to the 2% target. </p></div></div><div class="column"><div class="content"><h2>MS GDP Forecast Change  More Than A Mark-to-Market 230720</h2><p>US Economics  | North America GDP Forecast Change: More Than A Mark-to-Market </p><p>Fresh data point to  more strength in the industrial sector than we had anticipated.
