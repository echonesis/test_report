This report leverages our UBS Asia Strategy team's previous Q- Series   analysis that suggested that even if the bulk of manufacturing in China looks likely to stay,  the natural evolution of China's comparative advantage  opens up a gap for low- cost manufacturers to step into sectors that are more vulnerable to relocation. In this report, leveraging the expertise of UBS Asia Economics, Global Equity Research, and macro strategy analysts, we provide an integrated bird's eye view of the developing Asian economies that could gain from supply chain shifts, laying out their strengths and weaknesses across multiple dimensions. </p><p>Which countries in Asia can benefit from 'China + 1' supply chain shifts? </p><p> We use scorecard analysis  to evaluate the potential of individual Asian economies to accommodate supply chain relocation based on a group of fundamental factors. Four conclusions emerge from our analysis. 1)  No single economy has the potential to  match the scale,  size and competitiveness of China's onshore supply chain network. 2) Vietnam deftly rode the initial relocation wave as pre-existing domestic production networks and supply chain connections with China helped to give it a head start. However, the country is hampered  by its relatively small-scale infrastructure and the gaps within it.  3) India is better placed in terms of size to match China's edge in low-cost, large-scale manufacturing. India's policy   reforms and improving macro stability are clear advantages even though it is disadvantaged by high logistics costs, low labour productivity and regulatory impediments. 4)  In the  rest of  Southeast Asia,  higher production costs and a lack of scale remain key hindrances but a few of these economies may  carve out a niche in areas where they have a comparative advantage. We highlight Malaysia's competitive position in the semiconductor industry, as well as Indonesia and Thailand's emerging credentials in the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain. </p><p>Growth implication for India and Vietnam from supply chain relocation </p><p> We build a framework to analyse the impact on India's potential growth (6% YoY) under various scenarios   in which it gains market share in global goods exports. Were  China+1 supply chain shifts to continue and  India  to benefit from the government's  reform agenda and increased FDI, this could help India  move  towards 6.25-6.75% YoY growth by 2030 in our upside scenario and towards 6.75-7.25% YoY under a blue-sky scenario. The boost to direct job creation could be  1-4m per annum (with a similar  indirect impact as well).  Vietnam has been growing as a stable manufacturing hub. We expect continued supply chain relocation to play an important role in helping the country achieve its development goal of 7.0% annual GDP growth for 2021-30. </p><p>Market implications: what's priced into stocks? </p><p>Using a market-implied growth model, we observe that Indian and Thai equities appear to have priced in much stronger medium-term growth than pre-trade-war levels – some of this increase could be explained by some of the manufacturing opportunities being priced in. Looking at specific sectors, we see that industrials in India, Indonesia and Vietnam, materials in India and Malaysia, and the consumer sector in India have derated versus pre-trade-war levels, suggesting there is room for upside from this theme.

UBS strategists' analysis  estimated that only 30% of China's gross exports are in industries that do not have strong competitive onshore supply chain advantages (mainly in electronics assembly industries). Here, we think  the more structural factors, such as pollution control and rising  wages, may  drive this shift away from China in the sectors with competitive advantage. The UBS Global Tech team  estimates that nearshoring momentum has also been picking up, especially in the semiconductor industry given the challenges in global supply chain management and local government incentive programmes. We analyse which developing Asian economies  have the potential to optimise on  the supply chain shift opportunity  to boost their growth, manufacturing and employment prospects.  Using a bottom-up approach, our strategy team then uses a framework to identify how respective sectors are placed to benefit, looking at market share trends under the supply chain shifts regime. For a summary of the key points, see our Q&A below. </p><p>Question 1: Who are the best candidates for supply chain relocation? </p><p>Answer: India and Vietnam stand out as attractive destinations  for shifting supply chains – see Question 3  for reasons why. Malaysia may further develop its incumbent advantage in the electronics supply chain, while Indonesia and Thailand could make inroads into the EV supply chain. For more details, see country sections " Malaysia: an incumbent advantage " and " Will Indonesia or Thailand emerge as the leading producer of EVs in ASEAN? "). </p><p>UBS  Research </p><p>Figure 1: The Candidates in Developing Asia ex-China </p><img src="./results/fig_0.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Question 2: Will China lose global market share in goods exports? </p><p>Question 3: What makes India and Vietnam  attractive destinations for large-scale manufacturing in Asia? </p><p>Figure 2:  China has been growing as a value-added contributor to the rest of  Asia  </p><img src="./results/fig_1.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Figure 3: Vietnam vs India vs China </p><img src="./results/fig_2.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p> India              Vietnam         </p><p>Question 4: What are the key advantages and limitations for  other ASEAN economies? </p><p>    Malaysia     Philippines   Thailand      Indonesia      Singapore    </p><p>Figure 4: ASEAN-6 </p><img src="./results/fig_3.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Question 5: What are the growth implications for India and Vietnam building in supply chain relocation? </p><p>Figure 5: Asia competitiveness scorecard: India and Vietnam emerging as two prospective destinations for supply chain  relocation </p><img src="./results/fig_4.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>growth </p><p>Figure 6: India's possible market share gains in global   goods exports under the various scenarios </p><img src="./results/fig_5.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Figure 7: India's potential real GDP growth under various  </p><img src="./results/fig_6.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Figure 8: Sectors where we think there is opportunity for India </p><img src="./results/fig_7.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Figure 9: Consumer electronics and traditional manufacturing goods such as footwear and furniture have been  </p><img src="./results/fig_8.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Question 6: What are the key investment implications? </p><p>Most favoured stocks </p><p>Figure 10: Most favoured stocks by the relocation theme </p><img src="./results/fig_9.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p> How big is the opportunity for developing Asia? </p><p>China: the 'World's Factory' no more? </p><p>China's share of global manufactured exports fell in 2016-19, before rising during the pandemic. </p><p>Over 2015-19, China's export market share in labour-intensive consumer goods dropped, but it maintained its share in machinery and electrical equipment        </p><p>Based on goods trade data, China has lost export market share in the US, whilst continuing to gain it within Asia       </p><p>By geography, China ceded ground in the US market, and has lost share in labour-intensive goods.
