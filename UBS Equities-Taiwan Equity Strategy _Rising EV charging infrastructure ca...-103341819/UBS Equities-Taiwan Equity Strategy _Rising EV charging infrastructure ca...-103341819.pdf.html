<html><body><p>a b </p><p>Taiwan Equity Strategy Rising EV charging  infrastructure capex, who benefits? </p><p>Digging into the  global charging infra/battery swap station supply chain </p><p>We published a report   on potential beneficiaries in  the Taiwan equity  market of the global energy transition trend.  In this report, we delve into one of the pillars: transport electrification. UBS forecasts capex opportunities  of US$152bn for charging facilities and grid upgrades in the US  and Europe . The market seems  more familiar with leading charging station operators and auto companies in the US/Europe. In this report, we analyse the  supply chain and identify critical hardware component suppliers listed in Taiwan. The Taiwan government is accelerating its transport electrification to achieve net zero emission by 2050. We see rising capex opportunities in Taiwan and growing potential to export successful electric two-wheelers (E2W) battery swap services overseas. </p><p>EV charging stations: Taiwan manufacturers key component suppliers </p><p>The Taiwan market benefits from the transport electrification in two aspects: 1) electric vehicles have more  electronic components than traditional ICE vehicles. Taiwan, home to key semiconductor and hardware suppliers, is well positioned to capture the rising trend (beneficiary list: Figure 13). 2) Charging piles contain several important components, eg: charging modules (40% of total cost), charging guns/cables (20%). Aside from chips, Taiwan suppliers have penetrated the global supply chain of all other major components: a)  specialty cables/connectors: Sinbon supplies the top three charging station operators in the US. Bizlink is a cable supplier for Tesla's charging pillars;  b) charging guns/facilities: Voltronic's product (both AC/DC)  shipment is to start in H223. PhiHong supplies to Shell and Audi. Its new product could provide an output of up to 480kw (DC fast charging 30-360kw generally);  c) charging modules, power management, and total solutions: Delta is the world's top 5 charging pillar supplier and provides on-board EV power management solutions. </p><p>E2W battery swaps:  exporting to overseas markets </p><p>The Taiwan government is supportive of developing battery swap as a major E2W charging solution and offers subsidies to achieve its transport electrification goal,  100% new vehicles (both EV and E2W) sold  by 2040. We expect rising capex (US$1-8bn) for charging infrastructure in Taiwan, similar to other markets. We also see growth potential in the export of battery swap services  overseas, post successful operations in Taiwan. Battery swap stations could also serve as virtual power plants, helping stable/greener electricity supply for national  grids. </p><p>Stock picks: most favored -  Sinbon, Voltronic </p><p>We include companies that have sales exposure to the charging infrastructure and battery swapping capex opportunities (see Figure 11 and Figure 17). Although autos currently account for less than 20% of sales, we expect robust growth. Among UBS covered companies, we have Buy rating on Sinbon/Voltronic  and Sell on Taiwan Cement. </p><p>Global Research and Evidence Lab </p><p>Equity Strategy </p><p>Taiwan </p><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Taiwan Equity Strategy </p><p>UBS    Research  THESIS MAP </p><p>Pivotal Questions </p><p>UBS view </p><p>   EVIDENCE </p><p> WHAT´S PRICED IN? </p><p>UBS  Research </p><p>LEAST FAVORED </p><p>Sector Thesis Map MOST FAVORED </p><p>Sinbon, Voltronic </p><p>Taiwan Cement </p><p>Q: What is the role of Taiwan manufacturers in the transport electrification supply chain? </p><p>EVs have  relatively high electronic-related components than traditional ICE vehicles. Taiwan could benefit from the rising EV trend as Taiwan has solid credentials in  several key semis and hardware component manufacturing. For charging stations, aside from chips, Taiwan manufacturers have penetrated the global supply chain for key components, including charging modules and cables & charging guns. </p><p>more </p><p>Q: What are the capex opportunities from transport electrification in the Taiwan market? </p><p>We estimate a total of NT$34bn capex opportunities in EV charging infrastructure for Taiwan. There could be more upside if we consider higher EV/charging pillar ratio, electric grid upgrades, and solar power generation equipment at  charging stations. But we think E2W  charging capex opportunities are relatively limited after 2023. The leading companies have built widespread networks ahead of E2W rider growth. However, exports of battery swap services total solutions could bring more growth upside. </p><p>more </p><p>For H223, we identify four major positive themes in the Taiwan equity market: 1) quality dividend yield; 2) beneficiaries of rising AI application; 3) a semiconductor cyclical recovery; and 4) structural uptrend in energy transition. We are bullish about the growth potential of Taiwan stocks in the global transport electrification trend.  EVs, charging infrastructure, and battery swaps all have higher electronic-related components. This area has been the core strength of Taiwan manufacturers. </p><p>UBS estimates total capex opportunities for charging infrastructure in Europe and the US to be US $152bn. Tech companies have been diversifying into the auto industry. Some have up to 20% sales mix. The Taiwan government has a detailed execution plan  to achieve 100% EV by 2040. Our scenario analysis indicates capex opportunities of NT$34-254bn for EV charging infrastructure in Taiwan. Taiwan has built an extensive battery swap network (Gogoro and Kymco combined: 4,600 stations) for E2W, similar to the number  of petrol  stations. </p><p>EV sales mix and charging infrastructure capex opportunities account for a relatively low proportion of most Taiwan  stocks. It takes time for product certification and mass production. We think the market has partially priced in possible benefits from transport electrification. We expect share prices to rise  further once earnings contribution visibility becomes higher. </p><p>Figure 1: UPSIDE/DOWNSIDE SPECTRUM  </p><img src="./results/fig_0.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Taiwan Equity Strategy </p><p>Pivotal Questions Pivotal Questions </p><p>Q: What is the role of Taiwan manufacturers in the </p><p>transport electrification supply chain? </p><p> UBS    VIEW </p><p>EVs have relatively high electronic-related components than traditional ICE vehicles.

For example, Delta's has 10-15% of total sales from auto. Sinbon has 15% of total sales from autos and expects this to grow 18% in 2023. UBS estimates total capex opportunities for charging infrastructure in Europe and the US of US$152bn. </p><p>WHAT´S PRICED IN? </p><p>The sales mix from EV and charging infrastructure capex opportunities account for a relatively low proportion for most stocks. It takes a long time for product certification and mass production. We think the market has partially priced in possible benefits from transport electrification. We expect share prices to rise further once earnings contribution visibility increases. </p><p>Energy transition opportunities for Taiwan stocks </p><p>In November 2022, we published a report   discussing the Taiwan government's strategies to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Taiwan government plans total capex investment of NT$4,308bn (US$137bn) in 2022-30. The transition to green energy and phasing out of nuclear power could result in tight electricity supply in 2023- 24. Hence,  the government has  launched additional budget to enhance electricity supply resilience during the transition to green energies. In addition to the Taiwan market, UBS  identifies  capex opportunities from global energy transition of US$75-90tn through to 2050. We identify companies listed in the Taiwan market that could benefit from this rising capex trend in Figure 5. </p><p>UBS  Research </p><p>Figure 2: Total capital investments from energy transition in 2022-30E—Taiwan </p><img src="./results/fig_1.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Figure 3: 2050 Net Zero Pathway (key milestones) </p><img src="./results/fig_2.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Figure 4: Near- and medium-term signposts —Taiwan market </p><img src="./results/fig_3.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Figure 5: Taiwan stocks potentially benefiting from global energy transition </p><img src="./results/fig_4.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p> Zooming in on transport electrification </p><p>Figure 6: CO2 emissions by sector </p><img src="./results/fig_5.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Figure 7: Transport CO2 emissions by mode </p><img src="./results/fig_6.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Charging infrastructure capex to rise along with rising EV sales </p><p>US market: charging infrastructure a US$60bn opportunity </p><p>Figure 8: UBS global EV sales model by region (light vehicles sold) </p><img src="./results/fig_7.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Figure 9: EV charger build out—the US  </p><img src="./results/fig_8.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Figure 10: EV charger build out opportunity—the US </p><img src="./results/fig_9.png" width="800" height="400"><p>Figure 11: Key beneficiaries in global markets </p><img src="./results/fig_10.png" width="800" height="400"><p>====================================================================================================</p><p>Europe market: charging infrastructure  a US$92bn opportunity </p><p>What's the role of Taiwan in the  supply chain? </p><p>I.
